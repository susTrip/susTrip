# susTrip

**SusTrip** is a web application that records users' past trip information and respective carbon footprints. It aims to help users think more carefully about the mode of transportation they wish to take.

## Inspiration

We thought of the idea for susTrip when we noticed that Google Flights has a metric that displays the amount of CO2 produced for each trip, but Google Maps does not have that feature. We think that producing a feature that let travelers know the amount of CO2 they produced based on their modes of transportation would help them make more educated choices when it comes to traveling. Thus, aiming to contribute to the cause of sustainability and saving the environment.

## What it does

Users will input the mode of transportation and the distance that they travel, and the program will output the amount of CO2 produced from that trip. Users can also create an account to track their trip history through a personalized dashboard that provides an analysis of their carbon emission footprint. 

## How we built it

We build susTrip with [Convex](https://www.convex.dev/), which is a backend-as-a-service platform that stores an app's shared global state and manages it in a simple and convenient manner. Our application is built with React, TypeScript, and JavaScript and is run on the next.js framework and deployed to Vercel. The front end was completed with React.js and Mui. We use [Auth0](http://auth0.com/) to help with user authorization and authentication processes on our platform. Our domain, [sustrip.tech](https://www.sustrip.tech/) was provided by domain.com.

## Challenges we ran into

* Convex, OpenStreetMap, and Auth0 are new services that we have never used before. 
* There were unexpected bugs that required assistance from our mentors to resolve.
* Time limit
* Learning new technology in a short period of time

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

* Completed the prototype of the project and submitted the project to DevPost.
* Efficiently divided tasks to maximize our productivity.
* Combined various popular tech stacks into a meaningful project.
* Successfully deployed our full-stack web application.

## What we learned

We learned to use convex to write a full-stack web application and next.js react framework which we never worked with. We learned to effectively work and collaborate as a team to make the most out of our time.

## What's next for susTrip
We hope to establish a bigger community of users who would be interested in using susTrip, and we hope to scale our application and add more acute features.
